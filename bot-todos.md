# Bot Todos

- [x] ~~remove pic and video commands~~
- [x] ~~add developer set up and vibe coder setup~~
- [ ] add option to choose LLM (providing info for subscriptions)
- [ ] `/buildapp` data modeling interview — conversational flow that helps non-engineers define backend data models from their UX description, then auto-provisions Supabase tables and wires up the Kotlin data layer
- [ ] OAuth onboarding for third-party keys — use OAuth flows (Supabase, Apple, Google, Claude API) so non-engineer users can connect accounts with "click this link" instead of manually copying API keys. Removes the biggest friction point for sharing the bot with others.
